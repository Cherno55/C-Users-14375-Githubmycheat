As a newcomer to coding, I've recently developed a basic external glow cheat and would like to share it with the community. Please keep in mind that this code is quite rudimentary, featuring a simple on/off functionality for the glow effect. I have ambitious plans to expand its capabilities, but as a beginner, this is my starting point. I've been testing it on my primary account to ensure it remains undetected; however, it's essential to exercise caution when using it, as I'm not entirely confident in its security. Please use it at your own discretion and risk.
